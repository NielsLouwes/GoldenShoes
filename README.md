# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project's authentication runs via the backend and redux. Clone and start that repo first.

Make sure you are in the root directory where package.json is located.

npm install

npm start

It should run on your localhost.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
